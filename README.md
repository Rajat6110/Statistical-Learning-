# 📊 Statistical Learning Implementation

This repository focuses on implementing Statistical Learning concepts using Python with real-world datasets. It is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice by building models from scratch, understanding their mathematical intuition, and applying them to solve predictive problems.

The main aim is to learn how statistical methods work behind machine learning models and how they perform in real scenarios through hands-on coding.
